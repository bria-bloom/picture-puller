Linux utility to grab photos off of a particular plugged in device automatically


You know I just realized google drive/mega might be a better solution hmm...

depends if its free or not

sorry not to use this as a thinking scratchpad

but like if its free
but also data leaks and this is fucking pics of me so probably don't want that on dataservers somewhere

but is there anyway to verify MEGA's claims that they never had access to our password supposedly needed for decryption?  A lot of times passwords are sent in encrypted plaintext to be hashed at the server, but that's a huge security hole?  but there might be some problem with user side hashing too idr

but basically the same could be true of the pics.  idk if they're transmitting them as Enc(their https key, Enc(my key, my picture)) or Enc(their https key, my picture) and then using some public key/private key blah blah to encrypt it so that only i can decrypt the result?  Idk.

I'm probably being paranoid given that I post a lot of these to the internet in the end anyway. Hm.
